# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection


In this notebook, we will work on an imbalanced dataset(Credit Card Fraud) and explore various sampling techniques in combination with different algorithms to have a model that predicts fraud with our desired metric of choice. 

Inspiration for data exploration, visualizations and dimention reductionality bits has been taken from a few kaggle kernels. Kaggle link attached below. 

**Sampling Techniques touched Upon:** Random Under Sampling, Cluster Centroids, Tomek Links, Random Over Sampling, SMOTE

**Classification Algorithms Used:** Logistic Regression, SVM, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, XGBoost

**Dimention Reductionality Tecnhiques Explored:** PCA, t-SNE, SVD

**Dataset Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
